An h1 header
============

Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

2nd paragraph. *Italic*, **bold**, and `monospace`. Itemized lists look like:

  * this one
  * that one
  * the other one

> Block quotes are
> written like so.
>
> They can span multiple paragraphs,
> if you like.

An h2 header
------------

Here's a numbered list:

 1. first item
 2. second item
 3. third item

Note again how the actual text starts at 4 columns in (4 characters
from the left side). Here's a code sample:

    # Let me re-iterate ...
    10.times { puts 'Yay!' }

As you probably guessed, indented 4 spaces.

### An h3 header ###

Now a nested list:

 1. First, get these ingredients:

      * carrots
      * celery
      * lentils

 2. Boil some water.

 3. Dump everything in the pot and follow
    this algorithm:

        find wooden spoon
        uncover pot
        stir
        cover pot
        balance wooden spoon precariously on pot handle
        wait 10 minutes
        goto first step (or shut off burner when done)

    Do not bump wooden spoon or it will fall.

Notice how text always lines up on 4-space indents (including that last line which continues item 3 above).

Here's a link to [Google](http://google.com), and to a [section heading in the current doc](#an-h2-header). Here's a footnote [^1].

Tables can look like this:

size  material      color
----  ------------  ------------
9     leather       brown
10    hemp canvas   natural
11    glass         transparent

Table: Shoes, their sizes, and what they're made of

A horizontal rule follows.
